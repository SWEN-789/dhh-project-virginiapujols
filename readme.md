# Project 2: AT for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing

This project uses the Symbol Font For ASL to provide another form of reading text, in ASL jointly with the standard alphabet.

The webpage has two main features:
  - Inform the current weather for the Rochester area.
  - Display jokes.

When the user click one of the buttons, the information appears in both standard alphabet and ASL alphabet.

### Prerequisites
